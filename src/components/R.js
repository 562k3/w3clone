                R is an open-source programming language that is widely used as a statistical software and data analysis tool. R generally comes with the Command-line interface. R is available across widely used platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS. Also, the R programming language is the latest cutting-edge tool.

                It was designed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by the R Development Core Team. R programming language is an implementation of the S programming language. It also combines with lexical scoping semantics inspired by Scheme. Moreover, the project conceives in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a stable beta version in 2000.

                R programming is used as a leading tool for machine learning, statistics, and data analysis. Objects, functions, and packages can easily be created by R.
It’s a platform-independent language. This means it can be applied to all operating system.
It’s an open-source free language. That means anyone can install it in any organization without purchasing a license.
R programming language is not only a statistic package but also allows us to integrate with other languages (C, C++). Thus, you can easily interact with many data sources and statistical packages.
The R programming language has a vast community of users and it’s growing day by day.
R is currently one of the most requested programming languages in the Data Science job market that makes it the hottest trend nowadays.
