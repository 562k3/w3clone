            For top companies like Google, one must have solid Data Structure
            concepts, good communication skills, and an analytical mindset.

            Online Application Online assessments: After Google approves your
            application (resume/cover letter), you will be required to take an
            online assessment. Here’s an overview of the online assessment:
            Number of questions: 2 questions Time allowed: 90 minutes Topics:
            typical algorithm/data structure questions Technical Phone Screen:
            (30-60 minutes) Google’s interview process begins with a technical
            phone interview for experienced software engineers. During this
            stage, tech leads conduct interviews via Google Meet or Hangouts.
            Onsite: Onsite is the last stop. On average, 4 to 6 rounds should be
            finished in a day. Each round should take around 45 minutes and
            include questions on both system design and code. Interviewees note
            that more coding is done than system design, and expectations change
            depending on your skill level. Behavioral Skills(Googleyness): As
            part of its hiring process, Google wants to determine whether a
            potential employee has “Googleyness”, a value that the company uses
            to describe those who are culturally fit.
