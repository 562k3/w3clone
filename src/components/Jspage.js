            JavaScript is an advanced programming language that makes web pages
            more interactive and dynamic whereas HTML is a standard markup
            language that provides the primary structure of a website.
            JavaScript simply adds dynamic content to websites to make them look
            good and HTML work on the look of the website without the
            interactive effects and all. JavaScript manipulates the content to
            create dynamic web pages whereas HTML pages are static which means
            the content cannot be changed. JavaScript is not cross-browser
            compatible whereas HTML is cross-browser compatible.

                HTML page structure: The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.

                An HTML document can be created using any text editor. Save the text file using .html or .htm. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.
